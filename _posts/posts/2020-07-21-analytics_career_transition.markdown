This month marks two years since I made a major career pivot into the world of Data Science and Analytics. In my past life, I was working with the Investment Management group at a well respected private bank doing investment research and traditional, fundamental portfolio/risk management analysis... And it was awesome! I loved the people, the stimulating conversations, the forecasting and predicting of investment returnsâ€¦ the list goes on. But I knew there was a quickly developing field that would one day become an integral component of any analytical job. And that field required a lot of technical expertise, (particularly programming) which was an area in which I was lacking. So I took a leap of faith.

Fast forward two years later - with the help of numerous talented and dedicated professors, colleagues, and quite notably, StackOverflow, I am working in my desired field at the intersection of Finance and Data Science. I still have much to learn, and have only cracked the surface of a rapidly growing field, but my hope is that I am able to share much of what I have learned during this transition, just as others have shared with me.
