The purpose of this site is to showcase some of my professional skills in the field of data science and finance, while also giving me a chance to display my interests (like photography). Please feel free to check out some of my posts, whether it's finance/investments, data science, or landscape photography. Enjoy.

### My Story:  
I am an analytics professional with 6 years of experience doing asset management in the private banking industry and currently live in the Washington, D.C. area. I have a passion for statistical analysis and modeling with emphasis in financial data. I have spent the last year studying statistical learning methods (such as machine learning) and its applications in finance. I first developed my passion for this field when studying for the CFA Charter.
